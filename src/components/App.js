// Step 1: Import React, and Component from react.
// Step 2: Import render from react-dom
// Step 3: Import MoviesList from MoviesList
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import MoviesList from './MoviesList';
// Step 4: Write a class called App, extending Component.
  // Step 5: Write a constructor function without passing anything into it.
    // Step 6: Inside the constructor function, call super without passing anything into it.
    // Step 7: Inside the constructor function, create a state on this, and set it to an object.
      // Step 8: Inside the object, set a key to movies, and the value to an array of movies
  // Step 9: Write a render function.
    // Step 10: Inside the render function, write a return statement.
      // Step 11: Inside the return statement, write a selfclosing tag called MoviesList
        // Step 12: Inside the selfclosing tag, give it an attribute called movies, and pass it this.state.movies inside a set of curly bracket. 
// Step 13: Outside the class, export the App class as a default. 
class App extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      movies: ['Big', 'Jaws', 'Kill Bill']
    };
  }
  render(){
    return (
        <MoviesList movies={this.state.movies} />
    )
  }
}
export default App;
